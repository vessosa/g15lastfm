# G15Lastfm #

G15Lastfm is a Last.fm player for G15 gaming keyboards.
Currently the Last.fm client for windows doesn't support G15 keyboard, so this project intends to create an application to stream and play Last.fm radio with support to G15 gaming keyboard.

**Current version: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT**

**Source is available now!**

# Features #
G15Lastfm currently support:
  * Stream music from Last.fm
  * Send music information to MSN ("what I'm listening")
  * BAN or LOVE your favorite tracks
  * Search a radio and tune it
  * Check for updates (configurable)
