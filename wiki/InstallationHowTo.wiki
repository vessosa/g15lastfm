= Introduction =

G15Lastfm is a Last.fm player for G15 gaming keyboards. 
Currently the Last.fm client for windows doesn't support G15 keyboard, so this project intends to create an application to stream and play Last.fm radio with support to G15 gaming keyboard.

G15Lastfm currently support:
  * Stream music from Last.fm
  * Send music information to MSN ("what I'm listening")
  * BAN or LOVE your favorite tracks
  * Search a radio and tune it
  * Check for updates (configurable)

= Installation = 

Pre-requisites:
  * Java 6 x32 installed.

Instructions:
  1. Extract everything to a folder like "c:\G15Applets\G15Lastfm". Please note that this folder cannot have spaces (Is on my todo list to fix)
  2. Run g15lastfmplayer.exe

A new entry will be created on LCD Manager to start it automatically with Windows.
